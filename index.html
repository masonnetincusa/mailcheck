  <h1>What does a real MASONNET email look like?</h1>
  <p>A real MASONNET email will look like this:</p>
  <img src="realmail.png">
  <p>Notice how it isn't marked as spam, and that it has the official MASONNET email signature.</p>
  <p>Here's a few other factors to look for:</p>
  <img src="check.png">
  <p>Check the email address and make sure it's from @masonnet.org. Only real MASONNET emails will come from @masonnet.org.</p>
  <img src="check2.png">
  <p>Click "show original", and make sure that SPF, DKIM, and DMARC pass. They will on real MASONNET emails.</p>
  <p>Check the contents of the email. If there are spelling mistakes, or if somebody is asking you to buy gift cards, or send money, it's a fake email. We will never ask you to send payments to us via email. This is only done on official MASONNET websites/stores.</p>
  <p>If you're still unsure, send a screenshot of the email to us at masonnet@masonnet.org, and we will verify if we sent it or not.</p>
